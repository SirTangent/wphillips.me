# Who is Wyatt Phillips?

I'm an undergraduate engineering student currently enrolled at **Wentworth Institute of Technology** in **Boston, Massachusetts**. I have a major concentration in `Electrical Engineering` with a minor in `Computer Science`. I'm an avid programmer as I have experience with different languages. I also like to work with electronics and combine my software and hardware skills to create functional projects. Fun fact, I've never watched Star Wars, but I watch Star Trek from time to time.
